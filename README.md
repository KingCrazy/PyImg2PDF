# PyImg2PDF
A python script that converts a directory of images to a PDF

I made this because I was so fed up with websites charging me $15 a month to merge images into a PDF format.

Supports formats: PNG, JPG, GIF

## DOWNLOAD & INSTALLATION
[Head on over to the Releases page and download the latest version. That should be it.](https://github.com/KingCrazy/PyImg2PDF/releases/)

## HOW TO USE
Run the PyImg2PDF.exe and type in the path to the folder where your images are stored. The program will then create a file "converted_pdf.pdf" in the same directory. Enjoy!
